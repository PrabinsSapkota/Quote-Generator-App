# Quote Generator App 📝

A simple and interactive Quote Generator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app fetches quotes from multiple public APIs and presents them in a clean UI with dark/light mode support.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎯 **Category Selection**: Choose from various categories such as:
  - Cat Facts
  - Motivational Quotes
  - Number Trivia

- 🔁 **Random Quote Generator**: Get a new quote each time you click the **"Random Quote"** button.

- ⬅️➡️ **Previous / Next Buttons**: 
  - These buttons appear only when necessary.
  - Navigate back and forth through your quote history easily.

- 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes with a single click.

- 🔠 **Adjustable Font Size**: Increase or decrease the quote font size as per your preference.

## ⚠️ Note

Due to **CORS restrictions** or potential blocking of external APIs, fetching quotes may sometimes fail. If needed, a fallback version with a small array of pre-defined quotes can be provided for offline or demo use.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Explore and enjoy random quotes in your preferred theme and font size!

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure.
- `style.css` – All styling, responsive design, and dark mode support.
- `index.js` – Core logic for quote fetching, navigation, font adjustments, and theme toggling.

## 📌 Project Summary
